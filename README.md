# Data Science Portfolio

Hello and welcome to my repository of data science projects. It is a compilation of projects completed as part of online courses or just plain old curiosity. 

*The data used in all projects is for demonstration purpose only. All projects are presented as Python Notebooks.*

### *Visualizing Decision Boundaries for Iris Species*

This project explores the [Iris Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris?ref=datanews.io) and uses various classification algorithms to visualize decision boundaries. The notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/pallavishinde/Portfolio/blob/master/Iris%20Dataset/EDA%2C%20Decision%20Boundaries%20%26%20Prediction%20with%20Iris%20Species%20Dataset.ipynb). 

### *Classifying Survival on the Titanic*

Perhaps the most common first step into data science. [Here](https://github.com/pallavishinde/Portfolio/blob/master/Titanic%20Dataset/EDA%20%26%20Prediction%20-%20Titanic%20(score-0.80861)-%20FINAL%20EDIT.ipynb) is my notebook that goes through data exploration, feature engineering and prediction using Random Forest Classifer. The data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

### *Exploratory data analysis of 911 calls*

This [notebook](https://github.com/pallavishinde/Portfolio/blob/master/911%20Emergency%20Calls/911%20Calls%20Data%20Capstone%20Project%20.ipynb) looks closely the [911 calls data](https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/montcoalert/data) and using data manipulation and visualization gain a deeper understanding of the data. 

### *Predicting House Prices using Regression*

Using the [Ames Housing Data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) to create Regression model to predict house prices. The notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/pallavishinde/Portfolio/blob/master/Boston%20Housing%20Dataset/Boston%20Housing%20Price%20Prediction%20(Stacked%20Regression).ipynb) and goes through data exploration, data munging and prediction modelling. 

### *Exploratory data analysis of Flights Delays in US*

This [notebook](https://github.com/pallavishinde/Portfolio/blob/master/Flights%20Delay%20Dataset/EDA%20%26%20Visualization%20-%20Flights%20Delay%20Dataset.ipynb) explores the flight delays dataset to understand the trend in flight delays from airports to total delay times. 

### *Movies Recommender System* 

Item based collaborative filtering to recommend movies to users based on user ratings. The notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/pallavishinde/Portfolio/blob/master/Movie%20Recommender/Movie%20Recommender%20System%20-%20Movie%20Lens%20Data.ipynb).

### *Customer Segmentation for Wholesale customers*

Exploring the [Wholesale Customer dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers) to discover patterns and internal structure of the spending habits and create segments of different customer profiles. The notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/pallavishinde/Portfolio/blob/master/Wholesale%20Customers%20Segmentation/Customer%20Segmentation%20-%20Wholesale%20Customers.ipynb).
